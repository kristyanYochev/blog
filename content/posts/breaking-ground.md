I have been dreaming to make and publish a game practically since starting to
learn programming when I was 13. I have dabbled a bit with different engines and
game programming frameworks, but I haven't really made anything beyond copying
popular games for the sake of learning how they are made. Now having studied
Systems Programming in high school and on the verge of finishing my bachelor's
degree in Computer Science, I feel it's about time I try and do it for real.
